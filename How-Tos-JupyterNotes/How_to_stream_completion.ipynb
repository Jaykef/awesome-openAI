    "# How to stream completions\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when you send a prompt to the OpenAI Completions endpoint, it computes the entire completion and sends it back in a single response.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're generating very long completions from a davinci-level model, waiting for the response can take many seconds. As of Aug 2022, responses from `text-davinci-002` typically take something like ~1 second plus ~2 seconds per 100 completion tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get the response faster, you can 'stream' the completion as it's being generated. This allows you to start printing or otherwise processing the beginning of the completion before the entire completion is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stream completions, set `stream=True` when calling the Completions endpoint. This will return an object that streams back text as [data-only server-sent events](https://app.mode.com/openai/reports/4fce5ba22b5b/runs/f518a0be4495).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downsides\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using `stream=True` in a production application makes it more difficult to moderate the content of the completions, which has implications for [approved usage](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another small drawback of streaming responses is that the response no longer includes the `usage` field to tell you how many tokens were consumed. After receiving and combining all of the responses, you can calculate this yourself using [`tiktoken`](How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example code\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a Python code example of how to receive streaming completions."
